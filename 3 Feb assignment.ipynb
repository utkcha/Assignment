    "Q1. Which keyword is used to create a function? Create a function to return a list of odd numbers in the  range of 1 to 25. \n",

    "Q2. Why *args and **kwargs is used in some functions? Create a function each for *args and **kwargs  to demonstrate their use.\n",
    "Ans- *args is used to send a non-keyworded variable length argument list to the function.\n",

    "Q3.  What is an iterator in python? Name the method used to initialise the iterator object and the method  used for iteration. Use these methods to print the first five elements of the given list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,  16, 18, 20]. \n",
    "Ans- An iterator in Python is an object which allows a programmer to traverse through all the elements of a collection, regardless of its specific implementation. The method used to initialise the iterator object is the iter() method, and the method used for iteration is the next() method.\n",

    "Q4.  What is a generator function in python? Why yield keyword is used? Give an example of a generator  function.\n",
    "Ans- a generator function is a special type of function that generates an iterable sequence of values using the yield keyword. Unlike a regular function, which executes and returns a value, a generator function yields a value and then pauses its execution, allowing the calling code to continue its own execution. When the calling code is ready for the next value, the generator function resumes execution from where it left off, and yields the next value. The yield keyword is used to yield a value from the generator function. When a generator function is called, it returns an iterator object, which can be used to iterate over the sequence of values generated by the function.\n",
